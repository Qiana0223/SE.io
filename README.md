## Repositories
### [Approach Implementation](https://github.com/Qiana0223/wqp_app_1)
This is the repository hosting the code that implements an approach to making symbolic execution on Ethereum smart contracts more scalable.  The code is built on top of [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) and [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)

### [Experiment Code](https://github.com/Qiana0223/DataPreparation)
This is the repository containing the code to prepare for data for Singularity containerization based experiments and the code to extract experiment results.


## Papers
### [Papers on Security and Testing of Ethereum Smart Contracts](https://github.com/Qiana0223/bibliography_security_testing_smart_contracts)
A bibliography of papers on security and testing of Ethereum smart contracts.


### [Symbolic Execution Papers](https://github.com/XMUsuny/symbolic-execution-papers)
This repository is for collecting and grouping the symbolic execution papers and open source tools in recent years.

## Vulnerability Classification
### [Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry (SWC)](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry)
The Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry (SWC Registry) is an implementation of the weakness classification scheme proposed in [EIP-1470](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1469). It is loosely aligned to the terminologies and structure used in the Common Weakness Enumeration ([CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)) while overlaying a wide range of weakness variants that are specific to smart contracts.

The goals of this project are as follows:

Provide a straightforward way to classify security issues in smart contract systems.
Define a common language for describing security issues in smart contract systems' architecture, design, or code.
Serve as a way to train and increase performance for smart contract security analysis tools.


### [Decentralized Application Security Project (DASP)](https://dasp.co/#item-9)
This is the very first iteration of the  Decentralized Application Security Project (or DASP) Top 10 of 2018

This project is an initiative of [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.trust/). It is an open and collaborative project to join efforts in discovering smart contract vulnerabilities within the security community. To get involved, join the [Github](https://github.com/CryptoServices/dasp) page.
